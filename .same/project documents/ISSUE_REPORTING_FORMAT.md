# Better Issue Reporting Format Guide
## How to Report Issues Efficiently and Eliminate Miscommunications

## 🎯 **Why This Format?**

Traditional issue reporting often leads to:
- ❌ **Misunderstandings**: Vague descriptions
- ❌ **Time Waste**: Back-and-forth clarifications  
- ❌ **Incomplete Information**: Missing context
- ❌ **Reproduction Issues**: Can't replicate the problem

This structured format eliminates these problems and makes issue resolution faster and more accurate.
