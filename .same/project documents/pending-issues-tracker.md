### **9. Weekly Planner Date Issue - DATES ARE WRONG**
**Status**: üü° **IN PROGRESS - AWAITING TESTING**
**Reported**: 2025-01-24
**Description**: Weekly planner showing incorrect dates. Today is Sunday, July 27th, but the planner shows July 27th as Friday.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/planning/AnnualScheduler.tsx` - Enhanced parseCustomDate to handle multiple date formats
- `src/contexts/WeekNavigationContext.tsx` - Fixed date parsing for dd-mmm-yyyy format

**Solution**: 
1. Enhanced `parseCustomDate` function to handle multiple date formats: mm/dd/yyyy, mm-dd-yyyy, dd-mmm-yyyy, yyyy-mm-dd
2. Fixed `WeekNavigationContext` to properly parse dd-mmm-yyyy format when calculating week numbers

### **10. Contract Export Empty Columns - COMPANY/BRANCH DATA MISSING** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Status**: üü¢ **CONFIRMED FIXED**

**Description**: Contract export columns for company names, branch IDs, and branch names are empty despite checkboxes being marked and data being available.

**Files Modified**:

**Solution**: Moved computed field logic (companyName, branchIds, branchNames) to the beginning of the function before the value check.

**User Feedback**: "10. Contract Export Empty Columns - COMPANY/BRANCH DATA MISSING is fixed"
