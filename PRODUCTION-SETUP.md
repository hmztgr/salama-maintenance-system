### üéØ Deployment Strategy

**Branch Purpose:**
- **main** = Stable production for end user testing
- **restructured-contract-system** = Development branch for ongoing work

### üìù Setup Steps

1. **Create New Netlify Site for Main Branch:**
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect to same GitHub repo
   - Select **main** branch
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `out`

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Copy all variables from working site
   - Add them to new main branch site
   - Deploy

3. **Verify Production Site:**
   - Test EmailJS functionality
   - Test Firebase connection
   - Test all contract features

### üîó URLs

- **Production (Main)**: [Your main branch Netlify URL]
- **Development (Restructured)**: [Your restructured branch Netlify URL]

### ‚ö° Quick Access to Environment Variables

**From Your Working Site:**
1. Go to working Netlify site dashboard
2. Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Copy all variables
