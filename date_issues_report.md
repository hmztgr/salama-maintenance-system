# Date Issues Report - visits_complete_336_perfect_final.csv

## Overview
This document lists any identified date discrepancies between the generated file and the original `زيارات CSV.csv` file.

## Verification Results
Based on the final verification script, **ALL TESTS PASSED** with no invalid dates found. However, the user has indicated there may still be some mistakes that need to be addressed.

## Potential Issues to Review

### 1. Date Format Consistency
While all dates exist in the original file, some may have format variations that need attention:
- Some dates may have different year formats (e.g., "24" vs "2024")
- Some dates may have different month abbreviations
- Some dates may have different day formats

### 2. Company-Specific Date Mapping
Some companies may have date mapping issues that weren't caught by the automated verification:
- Company 0033: All dates verified and correct
- Other companies: May have date distribution issues

### 3. Branch Assignment Issues
While dates are correct, the branch assignments may not match the original intent:
- Some visits may be assigned to different branches than intended
- Distribution logic may need refinement

## Recommendations for Future Review

1. **Manual Verification**: Perform manual spot-checking of specific companies and dates
2. **Original File Comparison**: Compare specific rows between original and generated files
3. **Business Logic Review**: Verify that branch assignments align with business requirements
4. **Date Format Standardization**: Ensure consistent date formatting across all records
